I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method isPlacementValid(String, String) in class LinkGame, I implemented this method recursively, this is the first recursive method I have ever coded.
* The method removePieces(String, int) in class Difficulty, this is another recursive method. 
* The method makeTimer() in class Board, I code a fancy animation in this method.
* The method getSolutions(String) in class LinkGame, I optimized the algorithm so that it is more than 60 faster than before.
* The method getvalidorigin(String, boolean, char) and all the relevant sub-methods in class LinkGame, I used plenty of method to prune.
* The method getValidOrientation(String, char, char) in class LinkGame, the reason is the same as the one above.
* The inner-class Cartesian in the class PegArray, this is the first inner-class I have coded, so it is special for me.
* The sub-class Draggable, this is the first inheritance class I have coded, so it is special for me. 

I only list some impressive ones above. 
Although most of the codes I implemented in this assignment are not good at all, however, this is already the best I can do in the given time. Therefore, the codes here are all of my "best class", although most of them are ugly.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of building a score system of this game as new extension is coming from our tutor Jo-Lan Hu.
