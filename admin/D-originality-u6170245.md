I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage D of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* I look through http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm for learning javafx

My work at Stage D of this assignment includes:

* Add mouse events in the constructor of Draggable class: scroll to rotate the piece, right click to flip the piece, drag to move the piece, left button release to snap the piece.
  
* develop some methods used by mouse events, such as: flip(), rotate(), snap(), snapToHome()
