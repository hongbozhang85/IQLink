We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage B of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the following documented exceptions:

All the program design and uml plotting are done by our group independently, without discussion with any other group, or copy the design from any other group.

Except:

1 we refer to the GUI part of assignment 1 for learning JAVAFX and design our own GUI.

2 we use Google to learn the usage of "umbrello" and some basic knowledge/convention of uml.
